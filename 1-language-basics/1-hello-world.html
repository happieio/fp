    //programs break down into input, processing, and output

    //input comes in many forms from a user as typed letters or mouse licks
    //to other programs or functions within a program

    //naming is arguably the hardest aspect of programming. anything that has
    //meaning to a program will require a name, the names given must lend to
    //what the variable function is or does to allow other programmers to
    //meaningfully understand the code

    //variables or better constants

    //a program is broken up into pieces we can reason about called variables
    // in this FP guide, variable means we can assign anything to a 'variable',
    //but once that assignment is made it is not a variable in the sense that
    //we can change it later, so we will use the term constant instead,
    // which represents the nature of the data better.

    //constants can be data, like a number or a string of letters, or it can be
    // a function, which performs some operations on other constants

    //constant as data
    const two = 2;
    const aSentence = 'the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog';

    //constant as a function / processing other constants
    // this is a function definition, it is a template that can be reused
    const repeatSentance = (repeat, sentence) => {
        const numberRangeArray = _.range(0)(repeat);
        return _.map(() => sentence)(numberRangeArray);
    };

    //this executes the repeatSentence function and writes out the output to the console
    console.log(repeatSentance(two, aSentence));

    //statements

    //this is an assignment statement, all statements end in ;


    //evaluation expression
    const result = two === 2;

    //function expression / function invocation
    console.log('some output');

    //function declaration
    function hello() {
        return 'Hello World';
    }
    console.log(hello());

    function helloFormal(properProNoun) {
        return 'Hello ' + properProNoun;
    }

    const helloReference = function() {

    };

    const helloShorter = () => {

    };

    const f = x => {

    };

    //  () denote the execution of a function

    // () => {} is the shorthand for a function also called a lambda function

    console.log(helloFormal('Richard!'));
